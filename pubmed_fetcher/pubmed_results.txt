TI  - Nucleolin as a Potent Biomarker for Predicting Tumor Recurrence among Patients 
      with Hepatocellular Carcinoma after Transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Tumor recurrence poses a significant challenge post-liver 
      transplantation (LT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), necessitating the 
      development of more precise predictive tools. In this study we aimed to 
      investigate nucleolin as a biomarker for predicting HCC recurrence after LT. 
      METHODS: A cohort of 241 HCC patients undergoing LT was enrolled from three 
      medical facilities spanning January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2017. Utilizing 
      tissue microarrays, we assessed the predictive potential of nucleolin. Survival 
      analyses, including Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests, were employed to scrutinize 
      overall survival and recurrence-free survival. Based on univariate and 
      multivariate Cox regression analyses of preoperative parameters, nomogram and 
      risk score were designed to predict HCC recurrence and determine the 
      effectiveness of the model. RESULTS: The expression of nucleolin in HCC nucleus 
      was increased. High nucleolin expression in tumor tissues correlated with poor 
      overall survival and recurrence-free survival (5-year overall survival ratios: 
      34% vs. 64.8%, 5-year recurrence-free survival ratios: 36.1% vs.67.9%, all 
      p<0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified nucleolin expression 
      score, Hangzhou criteria, HBsAg, tumor differentiation and alpha-fetoprotein 
      level as independent risk factors for tumor recurrence in HCC patients post- LT. 
      A new nomogram is established based on the above risk factors with effective 
      prediction efficiency (area under time-dependent receiver operating 
      characteristic =0.742, concordance-index =0.7742). CONCLUSIONS: Nucleolin can be 
      combined with a nomogram as an effective tool to predict recurrence in HCC 
      patients following LT.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To explore the prognostic role of programmed cell 
      death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs). 
      METHODS: PD-L1 expression was detected using immunohistochemistry in tissue 
      microarrays from 96 GISTs samples. Survival of patients was assessed using Kaplan 
      - Meier analysis. Possible risk factors for GISTs were explored using Cox 
      proportional hazards regression models. The role of PD-L1 in GISTs proliferation, 
      invasion, and metastasis was assessed using colony formation assay, scratch, 
      transwell invasion, and migration assays. RESULTS: Survival in GISTs patients was 
      significantly associated with PD-L1 expression (p < 0.05). High PD-L1 expression 
      in GISTs resulted in relatively short overall survival (p=0.016). Univariate 
      regression analysis showed that PD-L1 was a risk factor for poor prognosis 
      (p<0.05). Compared with the control group, knockdown of PD-L1 significantly 
      decreased the colony formation rate, and cell migration and invasion were 
      inhibited compared with the control group. The wound healing ability of PD-L1 
      knockdown group was significantly weaker than that of the control group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that overexpression of PD-L1 is a risk factor 
      for a poor prognosis in patients with GISTs. Knockdown of PD-L1 significantly 
      inhibited the development of GISTs. PD-L1 may serve as a biomarker for the poor 
      prognosis of GISTs and a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - PurposeHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy in the 
      world, and tumor-infiltrating T cells have been shown to be closely related to 
      the prognosis of HCC. This study investigated the potential and efficacy of T 
      cell receptor (TCR) repertoire characterization as a biomarker for predicting 
      survival differences.MethodsIn this study, we used high-throughput sequencing 
      technology to systematically analyze the characteristics of TCR repertoires in 
      tumor tissues obtained from 23 long-survivors and 8 short-survivors diagnosed 
      with HCC.ResultsThe TCR composition in HCC long-survivors was found to be less 
      diverse than in the short-survivors. In addition, in the context of V and J gene 
      segments, long-survivors showed significantly higher usage of TRBJ1-3, TRBV10-1, 
      TRBV15, and TRBV6-5, and lower usage of TRBJ2-2. Both principal component 
      analysis (PCA) and the motif diagram of complementary determination region 3 
      (CDR3) sequences could clearly discriminate short- and long-survivors. And there 
      were five up-regulated and one down-regulated CDR3 sequences in the LS group 
      compared with the SS group. According to the characteristics of TCR repertoire, 
      we also established the survival-related evaluation system and the prediction 
      model for the survival period of HCC patients.ConclusionOur study adds to the 
      existing knowledge of TCR rearrangement profiles in HCC patients by elucidating 
      the differential TCR rearrangement profiles between long-term and short-term 
      surviving HCC patients. Also, our analysis identified a number of TCR genes that 
      are significantly associated with survival, and these may not only serve as 
      prognostic biomarkers but may also play an important role in antigen-specific 
      immunotherapy.

AB  - With the rising demand for liver transplantation (LT), research on acute 
      rejection (AR) has become increasingly diverse, yet no consensus has been 
      reached. This study presents a bibliometric and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) 
      topic modeling analysis of AR research in LT, encompassing 1399 articles. The 
      United States, Zhejiang University, and the University of California, San 
      Francisco emerged as leading contributors, while Levitsky J and Uemoto SJ were 
      key researchers. The most influential journals included the American Journal of 
      Transplantation, Journal of Hepatology, and Transplantation. The analysis reveals 
      a transition from traditional histological assessments to molecular diagnostics, 
      genetic and epigenetic profiling, and noninvasive biomarkers such as 
      donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) and microRNAs. Advances in immune 
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), cell-based therapies (Tregs, mesenchymal stem cells 
      (MSCs)), AI-guided immunosuppression, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery 
      systems reflect a growing emphasis on precision medicine. In addition, recent 
      exploration of microbiome-based therapies and regenerative medicine, including 
      MSCs and their extracellular vesicles, offers promising new avenues for reducing 
      long-term immunosuppressive drug dependency and enhancing graft survival. These 
      developments not only improve early AR detection and personalized treatment but 
      also reduce toxicity, foster immune tolerance, and expand the scope of 
      individualized therapeutic options. Global collaboration, supported by 
      cutting-edge research and AI-driven decision-making, remains essential for 
      refining AR strategies, improving graft survival, and achieving better long-term 
      patient outcomes.

AB  - We aimed to explore the comprehensive cancer landscape of Caspase-10 (CASP10). 
      CASP10, a member of the caspase family, is located at the human chromosome locus 
      2q33-34. Studies have suggested its potential role in the development of certain 
      cancers. To evaluate CASP10 expression in normal and pan-cancer tissues, we 
      integrated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GEO, Human Protein Atlas 
      (HPA), and UALCAN databases. The diagnostic and prognostic significance of CASP10 
      was analyzed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), Cox regression, and 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis. Correlations of CASP10 with clinical parameters were 
      assessed via the Wilcoxon test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and logistic regression 
      analysis. Genomic variations were explored with cBioPortal, GSCALite database, 
      and UALCAN databases. LinkedOmics database was used to detect the function of 
      CASP10 in pan-cancer. Interactions between CASP10 and the Tumor Immune 
      Microenvironment (TIME) were investigated using TISIDB, TIMER2, and TISCH 
      databases. The GSCALite database was utilized to assess the sensitivity of CASP10 
      to small-molecule drugs. In addition, Western Blotting (WB) was employed to 
      detect the expression of the CASP10 in our clinical Liver Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma (LIHC) and Stomach Adenocarcinoma (STAD) cohorts. The transcription and 
      protein expression of CASP10 significantly differ across cancer types, marking it 
      as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis. Its expression correlated with 
      certain clinical characteristics such as histological types and Alpha-Fetoprotein 
      (AFP) levels. CASP10 gene exhibited a 2% alteration frequency across pan-cancer 
      patients, with significant SNV and CNV profiles, and decreased methylation 
      levels. CASP10 was closely related to the Nuclear Factor-kappaappa B (NF-kappaB), TNF, 
      cell cycle, and JAK-STAT signal pathways. CASP10 showed correlation with immune 
      components in the tumor microenvironment, including lymphocytes, immune 
      stimulators, immune inhibitors, MHC molecules, chemokines, receptors, and 
      Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). Importantly, CASP10 could predict the 
      sensitivity of diverse anti-cancer drugs. Finally, WB analysis validated the 
      overexpression of CASP10 in LIHC and STAD tissues. Our comprehensive 
      bioinformatic analysis reveal the function of CASP10 on the diagnosis, prognosis, 
      and progression of diverse cancer types.
